   <p>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</p>
   <p>My name's Tiago and I'm a software developer. I currently live in Berlin with my two cats, Molly and Zoe, but originally come from sunny Portugal.</p>
   <p>I do mostly JavaScript and frontend development, but have been all over the whole web stack over the years.</p>
   <p>Outside of work, I'm a video game nerd, a sci-fi nerd, and I spend a lot of time combing music blogs for new and exciting bands.</p>
   <p>There's not a lot on this page, but the following links are where I generally post things online for others to see.</p>
   <ul>
     <li><a href="https://www.notion.so/Tiago-s-shared-documents-09818212546c47948a19fad821680b29">Notion</a> - This is where I write things, long form or not, posts, tips, etc. I use Notion heavily for note taking, work, and general like stuff. This is the page where I share some of those things with the world.</li>
     <li><a href="https://twitter.com/trodrigues">Twitter</a> - I tweet a lot.</li>

     <li><a href="https://github.com/trodrigues">Github</a> - Sometimes I share some code with the world.</li>
