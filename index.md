Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name's Tiago and I'm a software developer. I currently live in Berlin with my two cats, Molly and Zoe, but originally come from sunny Portugal.
I do mostly JavaScript and frontend development, but have been all over the whole web stack over the years.
Outside of work, I'm a video game nerd, a sci-fi nerd, and I spend a lot of time combing music blogs for new and exciting bands.
There's not a lot on this page, but the following links are where I generally post things online for others to see.

* [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Tiago-s-shared-documents-09818212546c47948a19fad821680b29) - This is where I write things, long form or not, posts, tips, etc. I use Notion heavily for note taking, work, and general life stuff. This is the page where I share some of those things with the world.
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/trodrigues) - I tweet a lot.
* [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:trodrigues) - I also bookmark a lot.
* [Github](https://github.com/trodrigues) - Sometimes I share some code with the world.
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tmcrodrigues/) - What I've been doing with my professional life.

You can always contact me via twitter or at `hello at trodrigues dot net`
Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜¸ðŸ‘¾ðŸŽ¶
