p My name's Tiago Rodrigues. I'm a Portuguese guy, currently living in Berlin. I work as a software developer, mostly on the web, and mostly doing frontend development and lots of JS.
p I spend way too much time getting to know new music of many kinds or watching lots of TV series and movies. I love video games but fail hard at keeping up with all that's out there.
p Find out more about me through my writing, or through my links to profiles on various other services:
